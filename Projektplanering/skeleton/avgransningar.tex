\section {Limitations}

The aim for our product is to be a proof editor providing the possibility to
check correctness in proofs for predicate and propositional logic. It will also
be able to provide hints on rules that could be applicative when constructing
a certain proof. What it will not do is to provide a full solution for any given
problem. The reason for this being both that the complexity of constructing such
a proof editor is beyond the scope of our project, but also that we want to
provide a tool for students to use as support when learning logic, rather than a
tool just showing them the answer.

The product will be customized for students taking a course in Logic, following
the course book Logic in Computer Science by Miachael Huth and Mark Ryan, at
Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg. The rationale
for this being that the proof editor will follow the natural deduction style as
presented in the book. Although, Logic in Computer Science is very commonly used
at other universities as well, which might lead to the proof editor following
this style of natural deduction useful for students taking courses in logic at
other universities too.r
