\section{Limitations}

The editor will provide a certain level of assistance, but it will not offer automated proof construction where a conclusion can be derived automatically from a set of premises. Since the editor targets students learning natural deduction, focus should be on the thought process rather than providing sample solutions.

The set of inference rules available in the editor will be taken from \textit{Logic in Computer Science} \cite{huth_ryan_2018} which makes the editor most suited for use by students taking a course which follows this book.
