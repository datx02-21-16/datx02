\section {Avgränsningar}

The aim for our product is to be a proof editor providing the possibility to check correctness in proofs for 
predicate and propositional logic. It will also be able to 
provide hints on rules that could be applicative when constructing 
a certain proof. 
What it will not do is to provide a full solution for any given problem. 
The reason for this being both that the complexity of constructing 
such a proof editor is beyond the scope of our project, 
but also that we want to provide a tool for students to use 
as support when learning logic, rather than a tool just showing 
them the answer.

The product will be customized for students taking a course in Logic, 
following the course book Logic in Computer Science by Miachael Huth 
and Mark Ryan, at Chalmers University of Technology and University 
of Gothenburg. The rationale for this being that the proof editor will 
follow the natural deduction style as presented in the book. Although, 
Logic in Computer Science is very commonly used at other universities as well, 
which might lead to the proof editor following this style of natural deduction 
useful for students taking courses in logic at other universities too.
