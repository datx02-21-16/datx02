\section{Social and ethical aspects}

It is not obvious how this project could be harmful to anyone. However, if the product ever becomes a recommended tool for students of a particular course or readers of some educational book, or if students were interviewed during implementation as a way to gather feedback, then that would place extra importance on the quality of the software. Students often work with tight deadlines, and software bugs can cause increased stress and frustration. The point being that if it is required that the software be used, it leaves students with little or no recourse in avoiding additional frustration should the software experience be subpar. This can be alleviated by keeping the tool optional for any potential user - only presented as an helpful aid - and therefore not forcing it upon anyone who could see it as destructive.

Another area of moral problems is whether the time would be better spent on
something else. There is a risk that the product will never see any real use, and that the report is never read. However, by evaluating issues with existing tools, we hope to bring improvements compared to what is available, as mentioned in previous sections. Also we choose to focus on the places where the product is most likely to see potential use. Thus the risk is minimised.

Looking at the bigger picture, our contribution could help to enrich society's general understanding of logic, if only by a miniscule amount, and it is hard to see anything regrettable in that. The 1942 short story ``Runaround'' by Isaac Asimov \autocite{asimov50} exemplifies how the ability to perform deductive logic when hard-pressed can mean a difference between life and
death, there in regard to the proposed \emph{Three Laws of Robotics}. Combined
with the coming uprising of artificial intelligence (AI) and knowledge on the
ethics of AI, or current lack thereof, it would almost be doing a disservice to
not proceed with the project.

As the negative points given above are comparatively minor, and as we have outlined ways of mitigating them, we deem it not necessary to consider societal and ethical aspects any further in the main report.
