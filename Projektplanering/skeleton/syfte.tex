\section{Purpose}
The main goal of the project is to develop a proof editor for natural deduction in both propositional and predicate logic. In the editor, a user can construct proofs, step by step, starting with a set of premises and then applying predefined rules to reach a conclusion.

In order to help students learn natural deduction, the editor will provide some assistance, based on the user's preferences. This include highlighting errors where they occur and showing which rules can be applied to the current set of clauses.

% \section{Syfte}
% The primaly goal of the project is to develop a proof editor of natural deduction that operates with both propositional and predicate logic. Moreover the editor will be implemeted in a interactive webb-GUI interface with different methods of proving the provided formulas deductively. In the interface, predefined calculus rules are available to choose from and apply to the formula until the proof is done and a conclusion is drawn. Would there be a flaw in the formula or if the user tries to use the wrong method along the way the program has a build-in error handling system which describes the mistake that was made. Furthermore this proof editor will have an aditional feature that allows the user to receive hints on the rules that can be aplicable when constructing a proof. Hence, this enables a more smooth program since it eliminates possible trial and error when getting stuck. This feature is not seen in any other proof editor and lets the user think before making a choice that then increases the overall learning experience.
