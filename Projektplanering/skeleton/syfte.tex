\section{Syfte}
The primaly goal of the project is to develop a proof editor of natural deduction
that operates with both propositional and predicate logic. Moreover the editor will
be implemeted in a interactive webb-GUI interface with different methods of proving the
provided formulas deductively. In the interface, predefined calculus rules are available
to choose from and apply to the formula until the proof is done and a conclusion is drawn.
Would there be a flaw in the formula or if the user tries to use the wrong method along
the way the program has a build-in error handling system which describes the mistake
that was made. Furthermore this proof editor will have an aditional feature that allows the
user to receive hints on the rules that can be aplicable when constructing a proof. Hence,
this enables a more smooth program since it eliminates possible trial and error when
getting stuck. This feature is not seen in any other proof editor and lets the user
think before making a choice that then increases the overall learning experience.
