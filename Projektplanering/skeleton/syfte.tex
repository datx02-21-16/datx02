\section{Purpose}
The main goal of the project is to develop a proof editor for natural deduction in both propositional and predicate logic. In the editor, a user can construct proofs, step by step, starting with a set of premises and then applying predefined rules to reach a conclusion.

In order to help students learn natural deduction, the editor will provide some assistance, based on the user's preferences. This include highlighting errors where they occur and showing which rules can be applied to the current set of clauses.
