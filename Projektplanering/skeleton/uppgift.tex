\section{Problem}

When designing the application, there are several factors to consider. From the user's perspective, the application must be easy to use, while the developer is more concerned with code quality and maintainability.

\subsection{Usability}
The application is meant to be an educational tool, aimed at students learing natural deduction. The editor itself should not require much introduction as this will draw attention from the subject. This means the application should adhere to the following principles.

\begin{itemize}
      \item There must always be a clear focus on the natural deduction process.
      \item Intuitive use and a steep learing curve are more important than maximising potential productivity.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the application should provide clear advantages compared to using pen and paper. To acheive this, there are some minimum features which must be implemented.

\begin{itemize}
      \item The editor should be able to validate syntax.
      \item The proof editor should be able to validate each step in a proof. If a step is invalid, the proof editor should give the user an error message prompting the user to fix the mistake.
      \item The proof editor should guide students throught the construction of proofs, for instance by showing which proof rules can be applied in the next step or partially filling in the next step towards the given goal.
\end{itemize}

Additional possible features are:
\begin{itemize}
      \item The user can save their proof in some convinient format, e.g. to use in a hand-in assignment.
      \item \textbf{Providing exercises to the user.} Give the user a choice of exercises to work on Additionally the exercises could be sorted according to difficulty or filtered to show only those with hints available.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code quality}

Intuitive interfaces and good support for the learing process make the application \textit{usable}. Another important part of the development is to make the application \textit{maintainable}, meaning it is possible to handle changing requirements or updates in dependency libraries without rebuilding the app from start. An unmaintainable app is inevitably going to break or become obsolete. To ensure the app is as maintainable as possible, it is important to use good practices for software architecture, documentation and code style.
