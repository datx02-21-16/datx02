TODO propositional logic rules : pbc and lem.

Not sure with pbc, but i was thinking about some pseudocode for lem atleast:

Lem doesnt have any explicit inputs to output a formula. However, the user will supply a formula
using the program in the gui somehow. A possible pseudocode (with tweaking in later stages ofcourse) could look like: 

func lem = do
phi  <- getInputFromUser        (From the gui)
phi2 <- getInputFromUser        (From the gui)
check isFormulaWellFormed phi  
check isFormulaWellFormed phi2
check that phi2 is a negated formula, thus has the form (Not (phi3)), if not throw error.
check phi3 == phi  , if not throw error
If all stages above are true, then output pure (Or phi phi2) else throw some kind of error.

In this proof the choice of y in the forall introduction is necessary to be
able to do the implication elimination. This is why we make forallIntro take two
arguments.
